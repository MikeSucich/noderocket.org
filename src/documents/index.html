<p>NODEROCKET is a full day event where JavaScript developers team up to build
  and launch JavaScript powered rockets!</p>

<p>Each team builds pressurized water rockets that run Node.js on a on-board
  microcomputer.  The on-board JavaScript reads the sensor data, deploys the
  parachute, and communicates position and orientation with the launch platform.</p>

<p>The launch platform is JavaScript controlled too.  It uses its own
  microcomputer to pressurize and launch the rocket.</p>
