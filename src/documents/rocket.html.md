Node Rocket
===========

Goals
-----

You can make your rocket as simple or elaborate as you want.  This page has
some tips and ideas you might want to incorporate in your rocket to make it
awesome.

Of course, the simplest water rocket is a plain 2-liter bottle.  Even without
 any elaboration, this can be lots of fun to launch.  And simply adding a good
 nose cone and fins can greatly improve the flight characteristics of the
 rocket.

To make our rocket really awesome, we add a payload with a Raspberry Pi,
and an automated, altitude-aware, parachute.



### Engine

The engine is the simplest part of the rocket to build.  All you need to build a single engine is one empty
2-liter bottle.  Later we will show how you can use (2) 2-liter bottles to create a double engine rocket.

** Parts List **

- (1) 2-liter soda bottle (preferably empty)
