Rocket
======

You can make your rocket as simple or elaborate as you want.  This page has
some tips and ideas you might want to incorporate in your rocket to make it
awesome.

Of course, the simplest water rocket is a plain 2-liter bottle.  Even without
 any elaboration, this can be lots of fun to launch.  And simply adding a good
 nose cone and fins can greatly improve the flight characteristics of the
 rocket.

To make our rocket really awesome, we add a payload with a Raspberry Pi,
and an automated, altitude-aware, parachute.

Construction
------------

** Parts List **

- (4) 2-liter soda bottle (preferably empty)
- (1) Sheet of corrugated plastic
- (1) Package of sticky back velcro
- (1) Roll of duct tape

### Engine

The engine is the simplest part of the rocket to build.  All you need to build a single engine is one empty
2-liter bottle.  Later we will show how you can use (2) 2-liter bottles to create a double engine rocket.

After cleaning off the label and the sticky glue, you're ready to add fins.

### Fins

Fins are a crucial part of any rocket.  There are many different ways that you can create fins for your water rocket, but
our favorite method is described in this [tutorial from US Water Rockets](http://www.uswaterrockets.com/construction_&_tutorials/removable_box_fins/tutorial.htm).
We like this method because it creates durable fins that are both adjustable and removable so that you can use them on
other engines.

You can make fins from lots of material like cardboard, foamboard, plastic, etc.  We made our fins out of corrugated
plastic, which is easy to work with and incredible durable.  The fins are attached to the engine using velco which makes
them easy to adjust to get straight and to move them forward or backward on the engine.  Ideally you want your fins to be
as far back on the engine as you can get.

### Payload Compartment

The payload compartment will house the electronics and will also form the nose cone for our rocket.  It is constructed
 from the tops of (2) 2-liter soda bottles.


### Parachute
