Rocket
======

You can make your rocket as simple or elaborate as you want.  This page has
some tips and ideas you might want to incorporate in your rocket to make it
awesome.

Of course, the simplest water rocket is a plain 2-liter bottle.  Even without
 any elaboration, this can be lots of fun to launch.  And simply adding a good
 nose cone and fins can greatly improve the flight characteristics of the
 rocket.

To make our rocket really awesome, we add a payload with a Raspberry Pi,
and an automated, altitude-aware, parachute.

We'll briefly cover each of the pieces that make a good rocket to give you
some ideas on where to start:

- Engine
- Fins
- Nose Cone
- Payload
- Parachute

### Rocket Physics

Before we start building though, let's have a quick lesson on rocket physics.
There are a couple concepts that we need to understand first:

** Center of Mass **

You can find the center of mass for your rocket by balancing it on your
finger.  When the rocket is balanced, the point above your finger is the
center of mass.

** Center of Pressure **

The center of pressure for your rocket is the point where all the aerodynamic
 forces are focused during flight.  It's hard to determine where this is
 without testing, but it's location is crucial to how your rocket will handle.

In order for your rocket to be stable in flight, the center of pressure needs
 to be closer to the tail of the rocket than the center of mass.  The further
 the distance between the two, the more stable your rocket will be.  If the
 center of pressure is closer to the nose of your rocket, your rocket will
 probably tumble in flight.

Adding fins to your rocket increases drag and moves the center of pressure
toward the tail.  Adding weight to the nose of the rocket moves the center of
 mass toward the nose.  Depending on the size and characteristics of your
 rocket, you'll want to adjust the size of the fins and/or the weight of the
 nose to improve your rockets in-flight handling.


Construction
------------

** Parts List **

- (4) 2-liter soda bottle (preferably empty)
- (1) Sheet of corrugated plastic
- (1) Package of sticky back velcro
- (1) Roll of duct tape

### Engine

The engine is the simplest part of the rocket to build.  All you need to build a single engine is one empty
2-liter bottle.  Later we will show how you can use (2) 2-liter bottles to create a double engine rocket.

After cleaning off the label and the sticky glue, you're ready to add a
nose cone and fins.

### Nose Cone

The simplest nose cone is the blunt end of a 2-liter bottle.  You can make a
more aerodynamic cone simply by crafting one from craft paper or cardboard.

Even better is a nose cone made from a plastic bottle.  You can cut the
nozzle off the end of a bottle just below the neck and this makes a fairly
good nose cone.  We've also used the end of a nerf football for a nose cone.

Finally, you could use a 3D printer to make a nose cone with just the
characteristics you want.

### Fins

Fins are a crucial part of any rocket.  There are many different ways that you can create fins for your water rocket, but
our favorite method is described in this [tutorial from US Water Rockets](http://www.uswaterrockets.com/construction_&_tutorials/removable_box_fins/tutorial.htm).
We like this method because it creates durable fins that are both adjustable and removable so that you can use them on
other engines.

You can make fins from lots of material like cardboard, foamboard, plastic, etc.  We made our fins out of corrugated
plastic, which is easy to work with and incredible durable.  The fins are attached to the engine using velco which makes
them easy to adjust to get straight and to move them forward or backward on the engine.  Ideally you want your fins to be
as far back on the engine as you can get.

### Payload Compartment

The payload compartment will house the electronics and will also form the nose cone for our rocket.  It is constructed
 from the tops of (2) 2-liter soda bottles.


### Parachute
